# Advent of Code 2025

This repository contains my solutions for **Advent of Code 2025**, a yearly programming challenge where each day of December brings a new puzzle.

I'm solving the problems in my own style, experimenting, learning, and having fun along the way. Solutions for each day are organized in their respective folders.

You can read more about Advent of Code and join the challenge here:
